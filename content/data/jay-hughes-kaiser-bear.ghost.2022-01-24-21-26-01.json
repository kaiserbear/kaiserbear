You’ll work weird hours sometimes, other times you’ll be\n   Dolly Parton. Get used to it.\n * You’re a superstar. If you’re constantly hitting walls with your learning,\n   people and processes — then be a freelancer. You can migrate to a consultant\n   and be paid to inform businesses on what they need to do.
